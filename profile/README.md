# Team S55 PoliTO

Founded in 2017, Team S55 began its journey with an analytical study on S55X and later engaged in the design and construction of a 1:8 scale flying replica of the electric propulsion S55X, making extensive use of composite materials and cutting-edge technologies.

Having completed its first version in 2021, the team has recently concluded the development of the second prototype: S5502.

We are now enthusiastically launching Project S55 HERA, aiming to create a long-range prototype by making structural modifications to S5502 and utilizing a hydrogen-based Fuel-Cells power system.
